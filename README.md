# UTown Queue Frontend Application

This app serves as the frontend application to help the queue managers track the status of the queue and call groups of people in the queue to the physical location when it is their turn. This app was made possible using the [SEAN Stack](https://github.com/sean-js).

## Comamnds

### Clean Start

To start using the stack, you need several dependencies installed globally and accessible in your command line  interface / terminal:

    $ npm -g install bower gulp mocha

### Starting Server

To start the server, use the command:

    $ npm start

Running the server by default will launch multi-threaded version even in development mode.

When in development mode, you can use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) by running the gulp task:

    $ gulp
